    "Q2. Eigen decomposition is a process of decomposing a square matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is significant in linear algebra because it allows us to represent certain types of linear transformations in a more interpretable form. Eigen decomposition helps in understanding the behavior of linear transformations and in solving systems of linear equations.\n",

    "Q3. A square matrix A is diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "a. The matrix A must be square.\n",
    "b. A must have n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the size of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "Let A be a square matrix of size n x n with eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ..., λn and corresponding eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vn. If A is diagonalizable, it means that A can be decomposed as A = QΛQ^(-1), where Q is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, and Λ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix Q will be invertible if and only if its columns (the eigenvectors of A) are linearly independent. Therefore, A is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The spectral theorem states that for every symmetric matrix, there exists an orthonormal set of eigenvectors that diagonalizes the matrix. This theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it ensures that certain matrices, particularly symmetric ones, can be decomposed into their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This diagonalization simplifies computations and provides insights into the structure of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a symmetric matrix A:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem guarantees that A can be diagonalized as A = QΛQ^(-1), where Q is a matrix whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors of A, and Λ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Eigenvalues of a matrix A can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The eigenvalues represent the scaling factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk when A is applied to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Eigenvectors of a matrix A are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by A, yield a scaled version of themselves. Eigenvectors are related to eigenvalues through the equation Av = λv, where A is the matrix, v is the eigenvector, and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Geometrically, eigenvectors represent the directions in which a linear transformation (represented by the matrix A) stretches or compresses space. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factors by which space is stretched or compressed along these eigenvector directions. In other words, eigenvectors define the axes of stretching or compression, while eigenvalues quantify the amount of stretching or compression along those axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Some real-world applications of eigen decomposition include:\n",
    "a. Image compression: Eigen decomposition can be used in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of image data while preserving the most important features.\n",
    "b. Signal processing: Eigen decomposition is used in methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze and filter signals in various applications, such as audio and video processing.\n",
    "c. Quantum mechanics: Eigen decomposition plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, particularly in the analysis of quantum states and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. For a given matrix A, there may be multiple linearly independent sets of eigenvectors, each corresponding to a distinct set of eigenvalues. However, the number of distinct eigenvalues is limited by the dimensionality of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. The Eigen-Decomposition approach is useful in data analysis and machine learning in various ways:\n",
    "a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that relies on eigen decomposition to identify the principal components of a dataset. It is used for feature extraction, data visualization, and noise reduction.\n",
    "b. Eigenfaces: In facial recognition systems, eigen decomposition is used to represent facial images as linear combinations of eigenfaces, which are the principal components of a dataset of face images.\n",
    "c. Eigenvalue-based algorithms: Eigen decomposition is used in algorithms such as the Power Iteration method and the QR algorithm to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices, which are important in various numerical computations and machine learning tasks.\n",
